# Budget

This project is a Single Page Application where users can add, edit, delete, and view transactions and categories. Users have the ability to search transactions by name or sort them by date or category. Throughout this project, I gained more experience with the Fetch API, Bootstrap, Entity Framework, and ASP.NET MVC.
